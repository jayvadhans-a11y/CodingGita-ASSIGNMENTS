console.log("Total Price =", totalPrice)
```

8. What is the result of `"25" + 10` and why?  

**Answer**
output= 2510
Reason= Because in javascript when a string and a number is added javascript first convert the number into string and then add them.

9. A person has ₹2000 in their wallet. They buy items worth ₹750 and ₹320. Write an expression using `+` to find the total spent, then calculate the remaining balance.  

**Answer**
```javascript
let priceInWallet = 2000;
let firstItemPrice = 750;
let secondItemPrice = 320;
let totalSpent = firstItemPrice+secondItemPrice;
console.log("Total spent =", totalSpent);
let remainingBalance = priceInWallet-totalSpent;
console.log("Remaining Balance= ", remainingBalance)
```

10. Predict the outputs and explain:  
    ```js
    console.log(5 + "5" + 5);
    console.log(5 + 5 + "5");
    console.log("5" + 5 + 5);
    ```

**Answer**
- output1 = 555. 
- Reason = because we always do addition from left to right so we first add '5 + "5"' and second 5 is string so answer is '"55"' them we add '"55"+5' here 55 is also a string so final answer is '"555"'
- output2 = 105
- Reason = because we first add '5+5' and both are number so answer is '10' then we add '10 + "5"' and 5 is string so final answer is 105.
- output3 = 555
- Reason = because we first add '"5"+5' and first 5 is a string so answer is '"55"' then we add '"55" + 5' and 55 is string so final answer is 555.

   console.log((-2) ** 2);
   console.log(4 ** 0.5);
   ```
   
**Answer**
Output1 = 512
Explaination = in exponentiation oppresion we do oppression from right to left. so we first do '3**2' which is 9 then we will do '2**9' which is 512.
Output2 = 64
Explaination = here we first solve the backet which is '8' then we will do '8**2' which is 64.
Output3 = 0.125
Explaination = here the power of '2' is '-3' so we will first do '2**3' which is 8 then we devide 1 by 8 which is '0.125'.
Output4 = 4
Explaination = here we multiply '-2' with '-2' so both '-' will combine and form '+' and '2*2' will form 4 so answer is 4.
Output5 = 2
Explaination = here the power of '4' is '0.5' so we need to half the value '4' and the half of 4 is 2.
